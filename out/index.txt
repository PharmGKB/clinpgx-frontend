2:T4ae,ClinPGx (Clinical Pharmacogenomics Resource) integrates the PharmGKB, CPIC and PharmCAT into a single resource. There is confusion in the community at times as to which project (e.g., PharmGKB or CPIC) does what, including specific functionality (i.e., CPIC writes genotype-based prescribing guidelines, PharmGKB implements different ways to access those guidelines including specific diplotype recommendations and compares those recommendations from different resources including CPIC, other guideline groups, FDA PGx and biomarker tables). The multiple websites require significant effort to ensure that the databases/KBs stay in sync not only across these groups, but with outside resources. PharmGKB coordinates this synchronization as well as data deposition from these resources to ClinVar. In addition, multiple resources require more effort by having multiple Scientific Advisory Boards, Steering Committees and work by volunteers, applicant institutions, and the NIH to elucidate the specific job responsibilities (i.e., a curator on PharmGKB vs. PharmCAT vs. CPIC vs. PharmVar). Lastly, as mentioned above, this has created a siloing effect of PGx that cannot and should not be sustained.0:["vEPkSWEYzWMAp0pVEQGjJ",[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","main",null,{"className":"container","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_main__GlU4n","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/logo.svg","alt":"ClinPGx.org logo","className":"page_heroLogo__lsLxJ"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$2"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Thus, we are excited that in the coming 18 months, we hope to formally launch ClinPGx with all resources below integrated.
